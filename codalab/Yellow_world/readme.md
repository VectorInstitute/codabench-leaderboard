YELLOW WORLD
============

## RESULT SUBMISSION

This example competition looks for submissions with "Hello World!"
It is the most basic example of Codalab competitions with RESULT submission.
In this example, users select the submission shown on the leaderboard.
This example is based on the original "Hello World" example competition of Codalab and was modified and checked for version 1.5.

NOTE: we provide the zipped and unzipped competition bundle for convenience. In the competition bundle, subdirectories should be zipped files (e.g scoring _program).

## CODE SUBMISSION
We give an example of how code can be submitted using an ingestion program:
* upload ingestion_program.zip to My Competitions>My datasets>Create dataset (choose type: ingestion program)
* go to the editor and uncheck "Results Scoring Only", then select in the ingestion program menu the ingestion program you just uloaded.
* submit the sample code: submission_4_ingestion.zip

For another example of code submission, see the Compute Pi competition.
