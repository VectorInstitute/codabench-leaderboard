<H3>Welcome to the GPU test!</H3>

<p>
This is a very simple bundle with code submission, not using an ingestion program.
The goal of this bundle is simply to test a queue of GPU compute workers, checking that everything is working fine.
</p>

<H3>Queue and docker</H3>

<ul>
<li>This bundle uses the following Docker image: <a>codalab/codalab-legacy:gpu</a></li>
<li><b>You need to set manually the queue to a queue containing GPU workers</b></li>
</ul>
