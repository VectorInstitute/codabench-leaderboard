This is very basic example of competition with code submission.
The participants must submit a function that computes pi and the result is compared to a standard.

The competition has 3 phases:
1. Development.
1. Feed-back.
1. Final test.

It features examples of uses of attributes of the YAML that are new to v1.5:
* public_data
* starting_kit
which allow showing downloadable data and sample submission in the Files tab of the "Participate" section.
