This competition is similar to the Iris Dataset competition in that it is
a classification problem. Where the Iris Dataset is 4 dimensional, this data
is 7 dimensional. Using these seven dimensions, correctly classify the seed
into one of three classifications.

### Bundles

- Results submission (scoring program only)
- Code submission (ingestion program + scoring program)
- Ingestion during scoring, running simultaneously
