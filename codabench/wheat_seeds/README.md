# Wheat seed classification

This competition is similar to the Iris Dataset competition in that it is
a classification problem. Where the Iris Dataset is 4 dimensional, this data
is 7 dimensional. Using these seven dimensions, correctly classify the seed
into one of three classifications.

The data for this competition has already been normalized.
