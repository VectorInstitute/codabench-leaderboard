# How to organize a challenge on CodaLab Competitions

Organizing a challenge allows you to crowd-source the most difficult scientific or industrial problems in machine learning (and not limited to ML!).
As a teacher, you can use challenges as practical projects and track the results of the students in a fun way, using the leaderboard.
Even as a student, organizing a competition is an excellent way to learn data science.
This short hands-on tutorial will give you everything you need to understand how to create your first competition â€” as early as today!

### Why Codalab?

Codalab is **free** and [open-source](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions)!
This means that you can deploy your own instance of the platform, or use the main deployed instance, [codalab.lisn.fr](https://codalab.lisn.fr/), and create your own challenge as early as today.
Codalab puts an emphasis on science and each year hundreds of challenges take place on it, pushing the limits in many areas: physics, medicine, computer vision, natural language processing or even machine learning itself. 
Its flexibility allows to tackle a wide variety of tasks!

Once you have an account, you can already publish your first competition! The only limit is your imagination.

### User roles

There are three (non-exclusive) types of users:

* Administrators, who manage the platform,
* **Organizers, who manage competitions,** <-- the focus of this tutorial
* Participant, who try to win the competitions.
